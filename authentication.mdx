## API Keys

All requests require authentication using an API key. Include your API key in the `X-API-Key` header of every request.

```bash
X-API-Key: bipa_prod_xxxxxxxxxxxx
```

## Key types

Bipa provides two types of API keys:

| Prefix | Environment | Purpose |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `bipa_prod_` | Production | Real transactions with real money |
| `bipa_test_` | Sandbox | Testing and development |

<Warning>
  Never expose your API keys in client-side code, public repositories, or logs. Treat them like passwords.
</Warning>

## Obtaining API keys

1. Log in to your [Bipa Console](https://console.bipa.tech)
2. Navigate to **Developers** → **API Keys**
3. Click **Create new key**
4. Copy your key immediately — it won't be shown again

<Note>
  You can only have one active API key at a time. Creating a new key will revoke the previous one.
</Note>

## Sandbox environment

The sandbox environment uses the same infrastructure but with test API keys (`bipa_test_` prefix).

In sandbox mode:
- No real money is moved
- Pix payments are simulated
- Trades execute with test balances
- Events are generated normally

## Security best practices

### Use environment variables

Store API keys in environment variables, not in code:

```bash
export BIPA_API_KEY=bipa_prod_xxxxxxxxxxxx
```

```javascript
const apiKey = process.env.BIPA_API_KEY;
```

### Revoke compromised keys immediately

If you suspect a key has been compromised, create a new one immediately. This will automatically revoke the old key.
