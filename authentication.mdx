description: "Secure your API requests with Bearer token authentication."

## API Keys

All API requests require authentication using Bearer tokens. Include your API key in the `Authorization` header of every request.

```bash
Authorization: Bearer sk_live_xxxxxxxxxxxx
```

## Key types

Bipa provides two types of API keys:

| Prefix | Environment | Purpose |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `bipa_live_sk_` | Production | Real transactions with real money |
| `bipa_test_sk_` | Sandbox | Testing and development |

<Warning>
  Never expose your API keys in client-side code, public repositories, or logs. Treat them like passwords.
</Warning>

## Making authenticated requests

Include your API key in the `Authorization` header:

<CodeGroup>

```bash cURL
curl https://api.bipa.tech/v1/customers \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer bipa_live_sk_xxxxxxxxxxxx" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

```python Python
import requests

response = requests.get(
    "https://api.bipa.tech/v1/customers",
    headers={
        "Authorization": "Bearer bipa_live_sk_xxxxxxxxxxxx",
        "Content-Type": "application/json"
    }
)
```

```javascript Node.js
const response = await fetch("https://api.bipa.tech/v1/customers", {
  headers: {
    "Authorization": "Bearer bipa_live_sk_xxxxxxxxxxxx",
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
  }
});
```

```go Go
req, _ := http.NewRequest("GET", "https://api.bipa.tech/v1/customers", nil)
req.Header.Set("Authorization", "Bearer bipa_live_sk_xxxxxxxxxxxx")
req.Header.Set("Content-Type", "application/json")

client := &http.Client{}
resp, _ := client.Do(req)
```

</CodeGroup>

## Obtaining API keys

1. Log in to your [Bipa Console](https://console.bipa.tech)
2. Navigate to **Developers** → **API Keys**
3. Click **Create new key**
4. Copy your key immediately — it won't be shown again

<Note>
  You can create multiple API keys for different services or environments. Each key can be revoked independently.
</Note>

## Sandbox environment

The sandbox environment uses the same base URL but with test API keys:

```bash
curl https://api.bipa.tech/v1/customers \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer sk_test_xxxxxxxxxxxx"
```

In sandbox mode:
- No real money is moved
- Pix payments are simulated
- Trades execute with test balances
- Events are generated normally

## Authentication errors

If authentication fails, you'll receive a `401 Unauthorized` response:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "type": "authentication_error",
    "code": "invalid_api_key",
    "message": "The API key provided is invalid or has been revoked.",
    "doc_url": "https://docs.bipa.tech/errors#invalid_api_key"
  }
}
```

Common authentication issues:

| Error Code | Cause | Solution |
|------------|-------|----------|
| `invalid_api_key` | Key doesn't exist or is malformed | Check the key format and copy it again |
| `revoked_api_key` | Key has been revoked | Generate a new key in the console |
| `missing_authorization` | No `Authorization` header | Include the header in your request |

## Security best practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Use environment variables">
    Store API keys in environment variables, not in code:
    ```bash
    export BIPA_API_KEY=sk_live_xxxxxxxxxxxx
    ```
    ```python
    import os
    api_key = os.environ.get("BIPA_API_KEY")
    ```
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Rotate keys regularly">
    Create new keys periodically and revoke old ones. This limits the impact if a key is compromised.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Use separate keys per service">
    Create different API keys for different services or environments. This makes it easier to revoke access if needed.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Monitor API usage">
    Review your API logs in the console regularly to detect unusual activity.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## IP allowlisting

For additional security, you can restrict API key usage to specific IP addresses:

1. Go to **Developers** → **API Keys** in the console
2. Select the key you want to restrict
3. Add allowed IP addresses or CIDR ranges

<Note>
  IP allowlisting is optional but recommended for production environments.
