## Introduction

Pix is Brazil's instant payment system, enabling 24/7 transfers that complete in seconds. Bipa operates as a Payment Institution with indirect Pix participation, providing:

- **Instant settlements** - Payments complete in under 10 seconds
- **24/7 availability** - Works any time, including weekends and holidays
- **Zero fees for receiving** - No cost to receive Pix payments
- **Multiple key types** - Support for CPF, CNPJ, email, phone, and random keys

## Pix key types

| Type | Format | Example |
|------|--------|---------|
| `evp` | Random UUID | `a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-abcd-ef1234567890` |

<Note>
  For now, customers will only be able to receive payments from Random keys (`evp`) or Static QR Codes (that also direct the payment to the Random key).
  Random keys are recommended for privacy as they don't expose personal information.
</Note>

## Amount encoding

All monetary amounts are returned as **string-encoded integers** in centavos (BRL smallest unit).

| Asset | Decimals | Example |
|-------|----------|---------|
| BRL | 2 | `"100000"` = R$ 1,000.00 |

<Warning>
  Never use floating-point types (`float`, `double`) for monetary calculations. Use arbitrary-precision libraries.
</Warning>

| `processing` | Transaction being processed by Pix network |
