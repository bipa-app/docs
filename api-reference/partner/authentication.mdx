## API Key Authentication

All Partner API requests require authentication using an API key passed in the `X-API-Key` header.

```bash
X-API-Key: your_partner_api_key
```

## Making authenticated requests

Include your API key in the `X-API-Key` header of every request:

```bash
curl https://api.bipa.tech/partner/v1/events \
  -H "X-API-Key: your_partner_api_key" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

## Obtaining API keys

Partner API keys are provisioned by Bipa during the partner onboarding process. Contact your Bipa representative to obtain your API key.

<Note>
  Each partner organization receives a unique API key. Keep your key secure and never share it publicly.
</Note>

## Security best practices

### Use environment variables

Store API keys in environment variables, not in code:

```bash
export BIPA_PARTNER_API_KEY=your_partner_api_key
```

```javascript
const apiKey = process.env.BIPA_PARTNER_API_KEY;
```

### Never expose keys in client-side code

Partner API keys should only be used in server-to-server communications. Never include them in frontend applications or mobile apps.

### Rotate keys if compromised

If you suspect your API key has been compromised, contact Bipa immediately to revoke the key and obtain a new one.
