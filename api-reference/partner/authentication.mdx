## API Key Authentication

All Partner API requests require authentication using an API key passed in the `X-API-Key` header.

```bash
X-API-Key: your_partner_api_key
```

<Warning>
  The Partner API uses `X-API-Key` header authentication, which is different from the main API's Bearer token authentication.
</Warning>

## Making authenticated requests

Include your API key in the `X-API-Key` header of every request:

<CodeGroup>

```bash cURL
curl https://api.bipa.tech/partner/v1/health \
  -H "X-API-Key: your_partner_api_key" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

```python Python
import requests

response = requests.get(
    "https://api.bipa.tech/partner/v1/health",
    headers={
        "X-API-Key": "your_partner_api_key",
        "Content-Type": "application/json"
    }
)
```

```javascript Node.js
const response = await fetch("https://api.bipa.tech/partner/v1/health", {
  headers: {
    "X-API-Key": "your_partner_api_key",
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
  }
});
```

```go Go
req, _ := http.NewRequest("GET", "https://api.bipa.tech/partner/v1/health", nil)
req.Header.Set("X-API-Key", "your_partner_api_key")
req.Header.Set("Content-Type", "application/json")

client := &http.Client{}
resp, _ := client.Do(req)
```

</CodeGroup>

## Obtaining API keys

Partner API keys are provisioned by Bipa during the partner onboarding process. Contact your Bipa representative to obtain your API key.

<Note>
  Each partner organization receives a unique API key. Keep your key secure and never share it publicly.
</Note>

## Authentication errors

If authentication fails, you'll receive a `401 Unauthorized` response:

```json
{
  "error": "unauthorized",
  "message": "Invalid or missing API key"
}
```

Common authentication issues:

| Error | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| `401 Unauthorized` | Missing `X-API-Key` header | Include the header in your request |
| `401 Unauthorized` | Invalid API key | Verify the key is correct and active |
| `401 Unauthorized` | Revoked API key | Contact Bipa to obtain a new key |

## Security best practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Use environment variables">
    Store API keys in environment variables, not in code:
    ```bash
    export BIPA_PARTNER_API_KEY=your_partner_api_key
    ```
    ```python
    import os
    api_key = os.environ.get("BIPA_PARTNER_API_KEY")
    ```
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Never expose keys in client-side code">
    Partner API keys should only be used in server-to-server communications. Never include them in frontend applications or mobile apps.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Rotate keys if compromised">
    If you suspect your API key has been compromised, contact Bipa immediately to revoke the key and obtain a new one.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Use HTTPS only">
    Always use HTTPS when making API requests. HTTP requests will be rejected.
  </Accordion>

## Request logging

All Partner API requests are logged for audit purposes. Logs include:

- Request path and method
- Response status code
- Timestamp
- Request tracing ID

<Tip>
  Use the tracing ID from response headers when contacting support about specific requests.
