title: "Mark Event Delivered"
description: "Mark an infrastructure event as delivered after processing."
api: "PATCH https://api.bipa.tech/partner/v1/events/{id}"
---

## Request

Mark an event as delivered to indicate that your system has successfully processed it. This prevents the event from appearing in undelivered event queries.

### Path parameters

<ParamField path="id" type="string" required>
  The unique event identifier (UUID)
</ParamField>

## Response

Returns an empty object on success.

<RequestExample>
```bash cURL
curl -X PATCH https://api.bipa.tech/partner/v1/events/550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000 \
  -H "X-API-Key: your_partner_api_key"
```

```python Python
import requests

event_id = "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000"

response = requests.patch(
    f"https://api.bipa.tech/partner/v1/events/{event_id}",
    headers={"X-API-Key": "your_partner_api_key"}
)

if response.status_code == 200:
    print(f"Event {event_id} marked as delivered")
```

```javascript Node.js
const eventId = "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000";

const response = await fetch(
  `https://api.bipa.tech/partner/v1/events/${eventId}`,
  {
    method: "PATCH",
    headers: {
      "X-API-Key": "your_partner_api_key"
    }
  }
);

if (response.ok) {
  console.log(`Event ${eventId} marked as delivered`);
}
```

```go Go
eventID := "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000"
url := fmt.Sprintf("https://api.bipa.tech/partner/v1/events/%s", eventID)

req, _ := http.NewRequest("PATCH", url, nil)
req.Header.Set("X-API-Key", "your_partner_api_key")

client := &http.Client{}
resp, _ := client.Do(req)
```
</RequestExample>

<ResponseExample>
```json 200 OK
{}
```

```json 404 Not Found
{
  "error": "not_found",
  "message": "Event not found"
}
```
</ResponseExample>

## Usage pattern

A typical event processing flow:

```python
import requests

API_KEY = "your_partner_api_key"
BASE_URL = "https://api.bipa.tech/partner/v1"

def process_events():
    # 1. Fetch undelivered events
    response = requests.get(
        f"{BASE_URL}/events",
        headers={"X-API-Key": API_KEY},
        params={"delivered": "false"}
    )
    events = response.json()["events"]

    for event in events:
        try:
            # 2. Process the event based on its kind
            handle_event(event)

            # 3. Mark as delivered after successful processing
            requests.patch(
                f"{BASE_URL}/events/{event['id']}",
                headers={"X-API-Key": API_KEY}
            )
            print(f"Processed and delivered: {event['id']}")
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Failed to process event {event['id']}: {e}")
            # Don't mark as delivered - will retry on next poll

def handle_event(event):
    if event["kind"] == "pix_key":
        handle_pix_key_event(event["log"])
    elif event["kind"] == "pix_inflow":
        handle_pix_inflow_event(event["log"])
    elif event["kind"] == "user":
        handle_user_event(event["log"])
    elif event["kind"] == "usdt_withdrawal":
        handle_withdrawal_event(event["log"])
```

<Warning>
  Only mark an event as delivered after your system has successfully processed it. If processing fails, leave the event undelivered to retry on the next poll.
</Warning>

<Note>
  Marking an event as delivered is idempotent - calling this endpoint multiple times for the same event has no adverse effects.
</Note>
