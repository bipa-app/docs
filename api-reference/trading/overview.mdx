## Quote vs Direct Trade

There are two ways to execute trades:

### Via Quotes (Recommended)
1. Get a quote with guaranteed rate
2. Execute the quote within 60 seconds
3. Trade executes at the quoted rate

Best for: User-facing applications where you want to show the exact amount before confirming.

### Direct Trade
1. Submit a trade request
2. Trade executes at current market rate
3. Final rate determined at execution

Best for: Automated systems, DCA, or when rate display isn't needed.
