## Units

Lightning amounts are denominated in **satoshis** (sats):
- 1 BTC = 100,000,000 satoshis
- 1 satoshi = 0.00000001 BTC

Common amounts:
| Satoshis | BTC | Approx BRL* |
|----------|-----|-------------|
| 1,000 | 0.00001 | R$ 2.13 |
| 10,000 | 0.0001 | R$ 21.30 |
| 100,000 | 0.001 | R$ 213.00 |
| 1,000,000 | 0.01 | R$ 2,130.00 |

*At BTC = R$ 213,000
